            <h2>Categorize</h2>
            <p>
              Our BERT model categorizes each incident report we receive. Our
              system is in beta, there may be some false positives (e.g.,
              incident reports where law enforcement was present but no
              use-of-force incidents occurred). Also, some false negatives
              (e.g., incident reports where use-of-force occurred and reported
              but do not make it into our system). To combat this, each incident
              report needs approval from the Blue Witness Administrative Team.

            <h2>Confirm</h2>
            <p>
              The incident report exists in our database and its status changed
              to 'approved' or 'rejected'. By keeping both in the database, we
              can be sure that our Twitter scraper doesn't pull in a duplicated
              instance in our database.

            <p>
              The Blue Witness project is a movement to give the public access
              to reports of police use-of-force incidents. By crowdsourcing
              incident reports from Twitter, we create a platform where people
              can contribute to a greater cause. Our database allows our users
              to export report data for their use. We strive to provide a single
              source of truth on the topic of police use-of-force, that the
              public can use to inform themselves in the current state of the
              issue.

              Human Rights First is an independent advocacy and action
              organization that challenges America to live up to its ideals. We
              believe American leadership is essential in the global struggle
              for human rights, so we press the U.S. government and private
              companies to respect human rights and the rule of law. When they
              fail, we step in to demand reform, accountability, and justice.
              Around the world, we work where we can best harness American
              influence to secure core freedoms.

              The Twitter scraper on the Blue Witness project is responsible for
              gathering tweets with content-specific criteria, including (but
              not limited to) keywords such as “police” and “misconduct” and
              their synonyms. It does this multiple times a day and checks the
              incoming data against data in our database to prevent duplicates
              from being entered into the database. It then passes them to the
              BERT model to be classified and awaits administrator approval. The
              Twitter bot is a tool that reaches out to Twitter users to confirm
              or supply the missing information. It is also triggered by the
              Administration Team, and new data gathered awaits approval before
              being marked as an 'approved' incident report. This enhances the
              Blue Witness administrator's ability to quickly update the
              incident map as well as the data available for download for
              researchers, journalists, students, and activists. If you'd like
              to know more, feel free to reach out to HRF on our contact page.
